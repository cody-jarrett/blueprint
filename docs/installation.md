# Installation

Blueprint uses Poetry for dependency management: [Poetry official installation docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

After setting up a new project directory based on this one:

1. Install depenencies

```bash
poetry install
```

2. Install pre-commit hooks

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

You're ready to go
